How did you design your application?
We decided separate this work in two parts. One part is user client (web bowers) connected to google map.
another part is "our web service(localGDP)" to get the location info from google, and sent location to GDP service 
to get GDP string number. 
The last is get the info from "our web service" then, show on the web bowers.
 


How can you lower the memory consumption and CPU use of the LocalGDP service? Any ideas on how to test this?


What does the HTTP request which is send to your localGDP service look like, when the client want to know the GDP for latitude 62.23186 and longitude 25.73656 ? What does the HTTP response look like?



If you implemented some mechanism to prevent hitting the rate limit, how did you do it?


What should be improved in this exercise if it is given to students in the future?
Nothing
